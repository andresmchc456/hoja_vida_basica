            I consider myself a responsible and humble individual,<br>
            committed to my duties and with a sincere approach towards others. <br>
            Additionally, I have the ability to remain calm and perform well in stressful situations. <br>
            My work experience includes three years as a professional police officer. <br>
            I also participated in a research seminar at the University of Valle. <br>

        <h3>Career Interests:</h3>
        <p class="container" class="texto-centrado">
            What truly excites me is Back-end programming, <br>
            where the essential logic of the code is crafted. <br>
            On the other hand, Front-end handles the aesthetic presentation and visual interface, <br>
            facilitating user interaction with the page. This field demands staying constantly updated, <br>
            and it is precisely this dynamic aspect that captivates me. <br>
